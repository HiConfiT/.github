## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We offer a range of open-source libraries and tools to support [Knowledge-Based Configuration].

Our current list of libraries and tools includes the following:

1. [**hiconfit-core**] - A set of Maven-based libraries for High-Performance Knowledge Based Configuration Techniques. Three key libraries are:
   1. **ca-cdr** - a library for Consistency-based Algorithms for Conflict Detection and Resolution.
   2. **fma** - a library for Feature Model Testing and Debugging
   3. **configurator** - a compact knowledge-based configurator supporting Matrix Factorization Based Variable Value Heuristics
2. [**KBStatistics**] - a Java tool that calculates statistics of given knowledge bases
3. [**FMGenerator**] - a Java tool that generates synthesized feature models

Documentation of these libraries and tools can be found in [hiconfit.manleviet.info].

## Used by

**CA-CDR-V2** and **CECore** are used by the following projects:

1. [FMTesting] - A Eclipse plug-in for feature model testing and debugging
2. A Python implementation of **CA-CDR-V2**'s algorithms can be found in [FlamaPy]
3. A Restful Webservice for developing product configurators with the following state-of-art technologies:
    - Domain reduction - decreases options that a user can select on the basis of previous selections of the user
    - Matrix Factorization-based Configuration and Recommendation - identifies Value Variable Heuristics on the basis of user requirements
    - Reordering the order of component's options on the basis of the Value Variable Heuristic
    - Conflict and diagnosis detection

and also used in the following published papers:
